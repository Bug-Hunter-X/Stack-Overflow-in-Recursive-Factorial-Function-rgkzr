# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  For large inputs, the number of recursive calls exceeds the stack's capacity, leading to a stack overflow error.  The solution demonstrates an iterative approach to avoid this issue.
